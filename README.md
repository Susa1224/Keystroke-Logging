# Keystroke Logging Demonstration

## Project Overview
This project is a functional Python-based keylogger developed as a mini-project for the **VOIS & Edunet Foundation (AICTE) Cybersecurity Internship**. It demonstrates the mechanics of input monitoring and data logging for security auditing and educational purposes.

## Learning Objectives
* Understand how to capture system-wide keystrokes using Python.
* Implement real-time data storage in a structured JSON format.
* Explore the practical application of the `pynput` library in cybersecurity.

## Features
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Captures "Pressed," "Held," and "Released" key events.
* **Structured Logging:** Automatically saves all activity to a local `logs.json` file.
* **Lightweight:** Runs efficiently in a terminal or IDLE environment.

## Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Library:** `pynput`
* **Environment:** IDLE / Kali Linux

## Installation & Usage
1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed.
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
